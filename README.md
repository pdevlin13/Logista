# Logista
Logista is a logging tool for SOTA activations (SOTA is a HAM radio activity), that runs under Pythonista3 on an iPad

Logista is an open source logging tool (not a logbook) for SOTA activations that is intended to run on an iPad under Pythonista 3. I am sharing the Logista Python code in the event that someone may find it useful.
I wrote Logista primarily to fit my preferred SOTA activation, logging workflow. Having tried using my iPad for logging on activations it always seems to go pear shaped in the middle of pileup. Wether it was the battery failing in cold conditions or the app hanging whilst doing a QRZ lookup due to the 4/5G connection issue, the result was the same, chaos ðŸ˜€. Paper and pencil have never let me down even in wet conditions. However, that meant that I now have an extra step in my workflow that I wanted to streamline. I have been using Hamlog on my iPad for a while, and this is a great app for doing your logging on an iPad but didnâ€™t tick all of the boxes for me.
So Logista was hatched in an attempt to create a more streamlined workflow that ticks all of the boxes for me, but quite possibly nobody else. Oh yes and of course the corny name Logista is a portmanteau word of logging and Pythonista.
