# Logista
Logista is a logging tool for SOTA activations (SOTA is a HAM radio activity), that runs under Pythonista3 on an iPad

Logista is an open source logging tool for SOTA activations that is intended to run on an iPad under Pythonista 3. I am sharing the Logista Python code in the event that someone may find it useful.
I wrote Logista primarily to fit my preferred SOTA activation, logging workflow. That is using a paper log and then typing it up once at home. However I still wanted to maintain the ability to log live on an activation and so Logista also offers this functionality. I have been using Hamlog on my iPad for a while and this has heavily influenced the style of Logista.
