12th Jan 2024   logista.py v1.1.7
	implemented a workaround for a problem caused when writing non ascii characters to the adi file. Some place names returned from a QRZ lookup
	contain non ascii characters sometimes. They are now replaced with "_" to make it more obvious that a non asci character has been stripped out.



7th Jan 2024 qrz_lookup.py v1.0.2
	Minor bug fix/ improved handling of returned xml data
	It seems some QRZ users do not populate the first name field. In this situation qrz_lookup would report call not found as it didn’t get the fname key returned.
	I have now added a bit of code to check if the first name is populated. if it isnt qrz_lookup will attempt to use name instead, by stripping out any titles and surnames.


6th Jan 2024 logista.py v1.1.6
	Fixed a bug where you could get a duplicate QRZ look up details if a callsign was not found. 


1st Jan 2024 logista.py v1.1.5
	Updated Logista.py to v1.1.5
	Tidied some PEP8 formatting.
	Added a feature to allow the option to add SRST and RRST to the Notes field of the SOTA csv.
	This is on by default and can be turned off by changing the 1 to 0 in the "rston" option line in the cfg.txt file
